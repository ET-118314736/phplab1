    <li> Blockchain technology is used buy a network of computers that join together to 
        manage the database that records Bitcoin transactions.</li>
    <br></br>
    <li>It allows bit coin wallets to calculate their spendable balance so that new 
        transactions can be verified thereby ensuring they're actually owned by the spender.</i>
    <br></br>
    <li>Information in the accounts is updated when a transaction is recorded. All the transactions are grouped together in blocks which are linked to other blocks.
    Therefore a record is created in chronological order and this cannot be edited because every block gets a specific reference from the block that came before it.
    In simple words the system is a block that cannot be moved or edited.</li>
    <br></br>
    
    <li>Blockchain is transparent regardless of what people say. The system is designed in a certain way so everyone is accountable and that no transactions are dismissed . 
        The transactions are recorded on a connected system of registers these are connected through a secure system which ensures no data is missed.</li>
    <br></br>
    <li> One such exmaple of Blockchain is in the healthcare system. Healthcare systems nationwide are using ablockchain component to provide proof of
        insurance information it is called RickBlock.</li>
